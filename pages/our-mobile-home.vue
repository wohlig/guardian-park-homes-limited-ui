            We assemble each home on-site from a timber frame kit, they are not
            finished in a factory and delivered on a truck. Assembling mobile
            homes on-site allows for higher build quality and lower cost. It
            also enables us to access hard to reach sites.

            Compare the similarity between our homes to Conventional New Build
            Housing - not log cabins or commercial mobile homes.

                <p>
                  The Floorplan designed to your specific layout and
                  orientation. Windows and doors which are designed to your
                  requirements and those of the location. The external cladding
                  and roof styles
                </p>

                  Lots of different names for a ‘mobile home’ but they are all
                  ‘caravans’! Mobile homes are technically regarded as
                  ‘Caravans’. There are touring caravans, Motor homes, static
                  caravans, twin unit mobiles. These are all caravans. You will
                  also hear the terms ‘Park home’ ‘leisure lodge’ ‘log cabin’.
                  These are not legal definitions. We strictly don’t use the
                  term ‘log cabin’ in legal or planning terms because it neither
                  refers to a mobile home or a building regulation dwelling. We
                  use the term ‘mobile home’ because this refers to static
                  caravans and twin unit mobile homes.
